        3/4 cup packed brown sugar
        1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        2 large eggs
        2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
        1 teaspoon baking soda
        1/2 teaspoon salt
        2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
        1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

        In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy.
        Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
        Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.
        Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
